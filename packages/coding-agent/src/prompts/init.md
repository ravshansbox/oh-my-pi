description: Generate AGENTS.md documentation for the current codebase
---

Analyze this codebase and generate an AGENTS.md file that documents:

1. **Project Overview**: Brief description of what this project does
2. **Key Directories**: Main source directories and their purposes
3. **Development Commands**: How to build, test, lint the project
4. **Code Conventions**: Formatting, naming, patterns used
5. **Important Files**: Entry points, config files, key modules
6. **Runtime/Tooling Preferences**: Required runtime (for example, Bun vs Node), package manager, and tooling constraints

Guidelines:
- Title the document "Repository Guidelines"
- Use Markdown headings (#, ##, etc.) for structure
- Be concise and practical
- Focus on what an AI assistant needs to know to help with this codebase
- Include examples where helpful (commands, directory paths, naming patterns)
- Include file paths where relevant
- Don't include information that's obvious from the code structure

After analysis, write the AGENTS.md file to the project root.
