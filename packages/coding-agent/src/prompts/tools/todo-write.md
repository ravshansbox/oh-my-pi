# Todo Write

Create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session.

<conditions>
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:
1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation
</conditions>

<protocol>
1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
	 - pending: Task not yet started
	 - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
	 - completed: Task finished successfully

2. **Task Management**:
	 - Update task status in real-time as you work
	 - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
	 - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)
	 - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
	 - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

3. **Task Completion Requirements**:
	 - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
	 - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
	 - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
	 - Never mark a task as completed if:
	   - Tests are failing
	   - Implementation is partial
	   - You encountered unresolved errors
	   - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

4. **Task Breakdown**:
	 - Create specific, actionable items
	 - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
	 - Use clear, descriptive task names
</protocol>

<output>
Returns confirmation that the todo list has been updated. The updated list is displayed to the user in the UI, showing each task's status (pending, in_progress, completed) and description.
</output>

<important>
When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.

<example name="use-dark-mode">
User: Add dark mode toggle to settings. Run tests when done.
→ Creates todos: toggle component, state management, theme styles, update components, run tests
</example>

<example name="use-features">
User: Implement user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout.
→ Creates todos for each feature, broken into subtasks
</example>

<example name="skip">
User: Run npm install / Add a comment to this function / What does git status do?
→ Just do it directly. Single-step or informational tasks don't need tracking.
</example>

<avoid>
Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

If there is only one trivial task to do, just do it directly.
</avoid>
