# Find

Fast file pattern matching that works with any codebase size.

<instruction>
- Supports glob patterns like `**/*.js` or `src/**/*.ts`
- Includes hidden files by default (use `hidden: false` to exclude)
- Speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel when potentially useful
</instruction>

<output>
Matching file paths sorted by modification time (most recent first). Results truncated at 1000 entries or 50KB (configurable via `limit`).
</output>

<avoid>
Open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds of globbing and grepping — use Task tool instead.
