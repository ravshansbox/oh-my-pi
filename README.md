## Development

### Setup

```bash
bun install          # Install all dependencies
bun run build        # Build all packages
bun run check        # Lint, format, and type check
```

> **Note:** `bun run check` requires `bun run build` to be run first. The web-ui package uses `tsc` which needs compiled `.d.ts` files from dependencies.

### CI

GitHub Actions runs on push to `main` and on pull requests. The workflow runs `bun run check` and `bun test` for each package in parallel.

**Do not add LLM API keys as secrets to this repository.** Tests that require LLM access use `describe.skipIf()` to skip when API keys are missing. This is intentional:

- PRs from external contributors would have access to secrets in the CI environment
- Malicious PR code could exfiltrate API keys
- Tests that need LLM calls are skipped on CI and run locally by developers who have keys configured

If you need to run LLM-dependent tests, run them locally with your own API keys.

### Development

Start watch builds for all packages:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Then run directly with Bun:

```bash
cd packages/coding-agent && bunx tsx src/cli.ts
cd packages/pods && bunx tsx src/cli.ts
```

### Versioning (Lockstep)

**All packages MUST always have the same version number.** Use these commands to bump versions:

```bash
bun run version:patch    # 0.7.5 -> 0.7.6
bun run version:minor    # 0.7.5 -> 0.8.0
bun run version:major    # 0.7.5 -> 1.0.0
```

These commands:

1. Update all package versions to the same number
2. Update inter-package dependency versions (e.g., `pi-agent` depends on `pi-ai@^0.7.7`)
3. Update `bun.lockb`

**Note:** Version bumping uses `npm version -ws` since Bun doesn't yet have workspace version equivalent.

**Never manually edit version numbers.** The lockstep system ensures consistency across the monorepo.

### Publishing

```bash
bun run release:patch    # Bug fixes
bun run release:minor    # New features
bun run release:major    # Breaking changes
```

This handles version bump, CHANGELOG updates, commit, tag, publish, and push.

**Note:** Publishing uses `npm publish` since Bun delegates to npm for publishing.

**NPM Token Setup**: Requires a granular access token with "Bypass 2FA on publish" enabled.

- Go to https://www.npmjs.com/settings/badlogic/tokens/
- Create a new "Granular Access Token" with "Bypass 2FA on publish"
- Set the token: `npm config set //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN`
